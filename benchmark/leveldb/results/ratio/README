Results of MRI when the read ratio of small and large images varies.
It runs mris_facebook in db_bench to the results. But the ratio is set to
various values intead of being fixed at 17.

The thput reported by iostat does not match that of db_bench. Further
investigation required:
1. iostat every second instead of 5
2. make workload larger (because program finish soon when ratio is large)
