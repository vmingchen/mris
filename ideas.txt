 ZFS allows you to add "cache" devices (presumably flash) to a pool of disks,
 and use heuristics at the filesystem level to determine what to move to the
 cache layer.  How would the same workload function on an unmodified leveldb if
 the backing store was ZFS for the hdd and you added the flash device as cache
 to the ZFS pool?
