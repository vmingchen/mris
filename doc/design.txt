- The inner data structure of KVDB can be aware of multi-tier storage (GTSSL)
	as used in Rick's SOCC paper.

Idea
- Exploit Advantages of Different Storage Devices (NVRAM, SSD, HDD, and SMR)

- Efficient Metadata Management
	Metadata is usually small in size and more frequently accessed; and raw
	data is generally larger. In the scenario of an image store, raw data is
	the raw images; metadata can be their thumbnails and the attributes
	describing images. 

Pros
- device-aware

Small frequently accessed data is stored in top tiers, such as RAM and SSD.
Whereas large less popular data is stored in bottom tiers. 

Transactional Image Store

Features
- Transaction

Key techniques
- Use KVDB as the infrastructure
- The inner data structure of KVDB can be aware of multi-tier storage (GTSSL)
	as used in Rick's SOCC paper.

Key words
- Tiered Storage
