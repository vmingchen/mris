Dear Sir/Madam,

This is Ming and Mike from Stony Brook University.  We are doing research
improving cost- and performance-efficiency of computer storage systems.  We
wonder if you have met some performance problems in accessing your large image
database which we can study and try to solve.  Can you kindly refer us to the
technical personnel who might be dealing with such problems? 

Thank you very much!

Sincerely,
Ming Chen  http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~mchen/
