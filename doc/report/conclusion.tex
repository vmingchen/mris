\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
We present a multi-tier key/value store using Flash SSD and HDD. It
exploits the size-tiered feature in many workloads, especially the
multi-resolution image workload. It achieves good balance of
performance and cost by leveraging SSD's high random I/O throughput as
well as HDD's good sequential I/O performance. With a small Flash of
5.9\% of the total storage capacity, it is able to improve the ops/sec
of an emulated Facebook image workload by 3.73$\times$.

\paragraph{Future Work}
We plan to further study the model of multi-tier key/value considering
cost, characteristics of different drives, as well as more workload
specific features besides the ratio of read small and large objects.
More threads will be used in benchmark to exploit better parallelism
in Flash SSD.
