Class Proposal of CSE602
Question about proposal 1:

* Multi-resolution Image Storage
Summary: Rejected

The class understands the idea of the project, however, the majority feels like
the application and use case for the final system are not evident.

	- You must present a use-case for the system to demonstrate that the
	resulting system will be of clear benefit to that scenario.

	- When presenting the proposal, you should more concretely explain which
	storage layers will be included in the hierarchy that you will use and how
	your system will exploit the specific properties of the available layers.

	- Come up with a cost model, how this tiered storage can achieve the same
	performance with less cache.
