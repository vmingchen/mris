[DONE] Collect statistics from Wikipedia images objects
* Design a simple and small test workload
* Find a KV store use multiple drives, besides GTSSL!
* Find an image processing software using MRI and see how the performance can
	be improved. [Thanks to Vasily]
* Come up with a cost model about how Flash size can be smaller [Thanks to Vasily]
* Use unionfs for differetiating small and large files
* Setup GTSSL mchen@story.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu:/scm/fslgit/staticfs-rick
* Come up with a cost model for replacement or migration that consider 1)
	average latency per object, and 2) the Flash characteristics
